uTorrent Uploader
=================

uTorrent Uploader is a script to allow the user to upload a single torrent or a directory that 
contains multiple torrents to the uTorrent server.

This script was created because I purchased a Buffalo Linkstation Pro Duo 6TB NAS, that has a 
built in torrent client.  Unfortunatley the client does not allow more than one torrent uploaded 
at a time.  I tend to add a lot of torrents in one go so to do this would take a condierable 
amount of time through their web interface and so this script was created.

I am putting it on Git as I was unable to find a working piece of code on the net to accomplish 
the task so someone else may find it useful.

Usage:
------

eg0r:uTorrent_Uploader dusty$ python upload.py --help

  --version             show program's version number and exit
